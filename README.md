# WythoffGeneralization
The Beatty sequences give exactly the winning positions for Wythoff game. For a large enough size of the chessboard, the computation of the winning positions becomes expensive, that’s why a recursive function (Grundy) is also used. However, it needs all the reachable positions which also grow a lot more for the generalized version of Wythoff I am interested in. On the other hand, a sequence that resembles that of Beatty beats this game. The computation problem still existing, I found another way of solving this game that uses infinite generated words formed by ‘a’ and ‘b’ and I show that this method is optimal.

This was a group research project done in collaboration with Jules Samaran and Yacob Ozdalkiran during our second year in the classe preparatoire Lycee Pierre de Fermat from September 2016 to July 2017. Supervised by Guillaume Brevet, this project was presented at the entrance competitive exams of several scientific schools such as Centrale Paris and ENS.
